<h2>Soo Yim</h2>
<p><a herf="https://www.thalassometry.wordpress.com "target="_blue" title="Combining or involving several academic disciplines or professional specializations in an approach to a topic or problem. Oxford Language">Soo Yim</a> is a <strong><u>multidisciplinary</u> artist</strong>
who currently lives and works on
the East Coast of Korea in Gangneung. At an
early age, she expressed a sincere
interest in the arts and began to
draw pictures depicting entrancing natural scenery. Later on, Soo studied Korean painting at Sungshin Womenâ€™s University, where she also received her master's degree. She currently specializes in traditional Korean techniques and mediums learned during her studies. Unlike other artistic methods, such techniques are based on East Asian philosophies and mythologies, giving her both the freedom and ease of mind to express her view of the world.
